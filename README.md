Department Management On Web is an innovative web-based platform meticulously crafted to 
bridge the gap between students and educators. Its primary goal is to provide a centralized

experience. Through intuitive design and robust functionality, the website aims to empower 
students to take control of their education while facilitating administrative tasks for teachers.

in one line, The Department ERP system must automate everything tedious and make things 
easier for the department management for both student and staff ends.
